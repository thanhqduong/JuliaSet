# Julia Set Fractal

#### Tech stacks: JavaScript, HTML/CSS

#### Description:

Consider the dynamical system $f: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C} $ given by:

$f(z) = z^2 + c$ for $c \in \mathbb{C} \text{ with } |c| < 2.$

The set of initital conditions $z_0$ for which the solution $(z_n)$ is bounded is called the Filled Julia Set for $f$.

The Julia Set is the boundary of the Filled Julia Set.

This project visualizes the Julia Set for different initital conditions $z_0$, obtained by the cursor location.
